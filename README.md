# Mortgage Extra Payment Paydown Calculator

This React project calculates the impact of making extra payments towards your mortgage principal. It demonstrates the potential interest saved and changes to the loan payoff timeline.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning experiment to practice math functions in React, utilizing Tailwind CSS, Shadcn and their new chart components.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to enhance this project with the following features:

- [ ] **Deployment:** Set up a deployment pipeline using GitHub and Vercel
- [ ] **Additional Charts:** Include more charts to display interest savings
- [ ] **User Login:** Implement a login system so users can save their charts
- [ ] **Plaid Integration:** Integrate Plaid to automatically retrieve mortgage information from banks and allow users to run scenarios based on potential extra payments

## Goals

Ultimately, I aim to add functionalities such as saving charts, user login, and integration with financial data providers to automate mortgage information retrieval and simulate various extra payment scenarios.
